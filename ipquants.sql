I am only passionately curious.</blockquote>\r\nTesla being without doubt one of the more innovative companies in recent years, let’s focus on Tesla this time around.\r\n\r\nOne of the best sources for identifying innovators is patent data. The only problem? It is extremely complex to extract valuable statistical information from all those patents. Let us try anyway.\r\n\r\nA good starting point is to get statistics about the individual inventor share with respect to the total patent filings of Tesla Motors. In other words, how frequent is any particular inventor at Tesla mentioned on Tesla patents?\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-195 size-full\" src=\"https://ipquants.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1__CZZdEv8Gx9zA_uWCjlegA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"235\" />\r\nTop 5 Inventor share of total publications at Tesla Motors with applied time filter.\r\n\r\nRestricting our query to patents filed in the last 5-years only, we see that Scott Kohn seems to be a key inventor and one of the main innovators at Tesla Motors. He is an inventor on roughly 14% of all Tesla patent filings since 2012! Thus, we almost instantly identified the key innovator at Tesla Motors. Based on the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-kohn-7633331/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-kohn-7633331/\">LinkedIn</a> profile of Scott Kohn, he is a manager within the battery technology group at Tesla.\r\n\r\nWell, that is all interesting, but “battery technology” is a pretty broad term. Our curiosity obviously leads us to the next obvious question:\r\n<blockquote>What is he really working on!?</blockquote>\r\n<p id=\"4a61\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Luckily, by clustering his patent filings into various tech sectors, we can get a good understanding of which s<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">pecific</em> technology fields he is active within <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">without</em> the need to spend endless hours reading all the actual patents.</p>\r\n<p id=\"3903\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By quantifying all his patents into such specific tech fields, we obtain the following top three tech sectors for Scott Kohn’s patents:</p>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-196 size-full\" src=\"https://ipquants.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1_fWmvha-yPCDgI-MaAQTsSw.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"502\" />\r\nTop three technology sectors of recent Scott Kohn patents.\r\n\r\nIt follows that Scott Kohn is mainly innovating within the battery safety tech field, such as battery over-discharge protection.

In particular, who did Jeff Bezos co-invent with?</p>\r\n<p id=\"b958\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It turns out that Jeff Bezos is a team player. Majority of his patents in the last 10 years — 88% to be more precise - he co-invented with one or more co-inventors. Besides such statistical insights, the ipQuants innovation statistics platform also retrieves the actual individuals that Jeff collaborated with.</p>\r\n<p id=\"0fd5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of the lucky individuals is <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allan-vermeulen-58835b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allan-vermeulen-58835b/\">Allan Vermeulen</a>. According to his LinkedIn profile, he is a “technical dude” (his words) at Amazon. As a technical recruiter, you probably would not have been triggered to check out Allan’s profile that easily. Especially, since LinkedIn does not provide any insights on his technical skills. While ipQuants does provide such insights, we leave those insights for a future post.</p>\r\n<p id=\"04ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Other co-inventors of Jeff Bezos are <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-hart-4317951/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-hart-4317951/\">Greg Hart</a>, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/de3ug/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/de3ug/\">Douglas Gray</a> and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ifreed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ifreed/\">Ian Fred</a> to mention a few of them.

As Albert Einstein famously <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/08/curiosity-is-as-important-as-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/08/curiosity-is-as-important-as-intelligence\">said</a>:\r\n<blockquote>I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.</blockquote>\r\nTesla being without doubt one of the more innovative companies in recent years, let’s focus on Tesla this time around.\r\n\r\nOne of the best sources for identifying innovators is patent data. The only problem? It is extremely complex to extract valuable statistical information from all those patents. Let us try anyway.\r\n\r\nA good starting point is to get statistics about the individual inventor share with respect to the total patent filings of Tesla Motors. In other words, how frequent is any particular inventor at Tesla mentioned on Tesla patents?\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-195 size-full\" src=\"https://localhost/ipquants/dist/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1__CZZdEv8Gx9zA_uWCjlegA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"235\" />\r\nTop 5 Inventor share of total publications at Tesla Motors with applied time filter.\r\n\r\nRestricting our query to patents filed in the last 5-years only, we see that Scott Kohn seems to be a key inventor and one of the main innovators at Tesla Motors. He is an inventor on roughly 14% of all Tesla patent filings since 2012! Thus, we almost instantly identified the key innovator at Tesla Motors. Based on the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-kohn-7633331/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-kohn-7633331/\">LinkedIn</a> profile of Scott Kohn, he is a manager within the battery technology group at Tesla.\r\n\r\nWell, that is all interesting, but “battery technology” is a pretty broad term. Our curiosity obviously leads us to the next obvious question:\r\n<blockquote>What is he really working on!?</blockquote>\r\n<p id=\"4a61\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Luckily, by clustering his patent filings into various tech sectors, we can get a good understanding of which s<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">pecific</em> technology fields he is active within <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">without</em> the need to spend endless hours reading all the actual patents.</p>\r\n<p id=\"3903\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By quantifying all his patents into such specific tech fields, we obtain the following top three tech sectors for Scott Kohn’s patents:</p>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-196 size-full\" src=\"https://localhost/ipquants/dist/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1_fWmvha-yPCDgI-MaAQTsSw.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"502\" />\r\nTop three technology sectors of recent Scott Kohn patents.\r\n\r\nIt follows that Scott Kohn is mainly innovating within the battery safety tech field, such as battery over-discharge protection.

In this post, we will outline how mining patent data can help identifying innovative companies and individuals in the speech technology space.</p>\r\n<p id=\"a95d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Obviously, we will not go through the actual patents themselves to get the high-level overview we want, because that would not be very efficient. But by clustering e.g. patents in particular tech categories, we can efficiently identify relevant patents and their respective owners and inventors.</p>\r\n<p id=\"a2b1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let’s focus on patents clustered into the speech recognition category, more specifically any patent filed with respect to the following category:</p>\r\n\r\n<figure id=\"491c\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-188 size-full\" src=\"https://ipquants.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1_D9MZxtjOCwyBVfZHibZ-_w.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"85\" /></div></figure>\r\n<div>\r\n<p id=\"4c75\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The tech clustering we utilise is based on the so called Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC; we will spare you the details!). The CPC codes, such as G10L15/08, are maintained by the patent offices. At ipQuants we have re-structured these codes for our innovation insights purposes.</p>\r\n<p id=\"edd6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This enables us to look at much more detailed technology clusters. Instead of just reviewing “speech technology” clusters, we will focus on Speech recognition with respect to<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> speech classification or search</em>.</p>\r\n<p id=\"8676\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Based on such a cluster, we get the following patent publication trend for filings between year 2000 and 2016 at the top patent offices. Note that by law patents are published with a 18-month time lag, so that explains the highlighted part in the below chart.</p>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-189 size-full\" src=\"https://ipquants.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1_NIo2psez7g2JkpeGyn3JSQ.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" />\r\n\r\nYear 2000 to 2016 Patent Publication trend for the Tech Sector: <em class=\"markup--em markup--figure-em\">Speech recognition; </em>Speech classification or search\r\n<p id=\"2293\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">From above chart it is clear; there has been significant R&amp;D activity in this technology domain in recent years. Obviously, we would like to know which organisations and individuals are behind these numbers.</p>\r\n<p id=\"1c19\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Looking at the top patent filers in the last three years, we find the usual suspects among the top companies. Remember, we are just looking at a subset of filings of each of these companies.

Still puzzled? Well, turns out that all those phone calls the inmates conduct are monitored for various reasons.

In this post, we will outline how mining patent data can help identifying innovative companies and individuals in the speech technology space.</p>\r\n<p id=\"a95d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Obviously, we will not go through the actual patents themselves to get the high-level overview we want, because that would not be very efficient. But by clustering e.g. patents in particular tech categories, we can efficiently identify relevant patents and their respective owners and inventors.</p>\r\n<p id=\"a2b1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let’s focus on patents clustered into the speech recognition category, more specifically any patent filed with respect to the following category:</p>\r\n\r\n<figure id=\"491c\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-188 size-full\" src=\"https://ipquants.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1_D9MZxtjOCwyBVfZHibZ-_w.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"85\" /></div></figure>\r\n<p id=\"4c75\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The tech clustering we utilise is based on the so called Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC; we will spare you the details!). The CPC codes, such as G10L15/08, are maintained by the patent offices. At ipQuants we have re-structured these codes for our innovation insights purposes.</p>\r\n<p id=\"edd6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This enables us to look at much more detailed technology clusters. Instead of just reviewing “speech technology” clusters, we will focus on Speech recognition with respect to<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> speech classification or search</em>.</p>\r\n<p id=\"8676\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Based on such a cluster, we get the following patent publication trend for filings between year 2000 and 2016 at the top patent offices. Note that by law patents are published with a 18-month time lag, so that explains the highlighted part in the below chart.</p>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-189 size-full\" src=\"https://ipquants.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1_NIo2psez7g2JkpeGyn3JSQ.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" />\r\n\r\nYear 2000 to 2016 Patent Publication trend for the Tech Sector: <em class=\"markup--em markup--figure-em\">Speech recognition; </em>Speech classification or search\r\n<p id=\"2293\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">From above chart it is clear; there has been significant R&amp;D activity in this technology domain in recent years. Obviously, we would like to know which organisations and individuals are behind these numbers.</p>\r\n<p id=\"1c19\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Looking at the top patent filers in the last three years, we find the usual suspects among the top companies. Remember, we are just looking at a subset of filings of each of these companies. They could have many more speech tech related patents in other speech tech domains.</p>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-190 size-full\" src=\"https://ipquants.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1_davGuPzMgtXe5bSDbeK1yw.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" />\r\n<figure id=\"cd1a\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Year 2014 to 2017 top 10 patent applicants for CPC G10L15/08</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p id=\"cc82\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Google, Amazon and Microsoft are all expected probably. But what about <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Securus Technologies</em>? Never heard of them? You are probably not alone.</p>\r\n<p id=\"b773\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">According to its website, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://securustech.net/web/securus/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://securustech.net/web/securus/about-us\">Securus Technologies</a> is the largest prison inmate communication provider. Still puzzled? Well, turns out that all those phone calls the inmates conduct are monitored for various reasons. One of its patents describes how it conducts <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">automatic keyword searching</em> during inmate phone calls… Thus, the Securus inventors seem to have very relevant know-how in the field of speech tech.</p>\r\n<p id=\"b372\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As a talent sourcer and recruiter for one of the top tech firms, would you have considered searching for speech technology talent at a prison security provider, such as Securus Technologies?</p>\r\n<p id=\"5baa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Above is just one of many examples on how focusing on quantifying innovators and looking at the statistics for a particular technology field, can lead to unexpected and highly valuable insights.</p>', 'Finding Tech Talent', 'You cannot have missed the furious investment efforts into the different type of intelligent personal assistants that intend...', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '187-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-05-31 14:39:12', '2018-05-31 14:39:12', '', 187, 'https://ipquants.com/187-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

What advice will you deliver? Will you recommend filing an appeal or accepting the Examiner’s decision?\r\n\r\n<strong>To Appeal or Not to Appeal? </strong>\r\n\r\nWe have all been there as attorneys, managing a pro-and-con evaluation that far-too-often ends with a hunch.

A piece of objective data that substantiates the wisdom to proceed, and helps you avoid delivering advice like this:\r\n\r\n<em>“We will apply the same arguments we made during examination, but this time the outcome will be different. The Appeal Board will get it. Trust us.”</em>\r\n\r\nOften times, appeal recommendations are based on an assumption or belief that, because they are more experienced, Board Members will recognize the merits of your arguments that were obviously and unfortunately overlooked the first time. Would you feel as confident if you had to wager your money rather than your client’s on the outcome?\r\n\r\n<strong>Do Appeal Boards Really See Things Differently? </strong>\r\n\r\nAn important part of the appeal recommendation process is to provide the client with an estimate of the likelihood of success. A common starting point is to survey peers and partners. You could ask them about their experience under these circumstances. If you’re lucky to chat with enough colleagues and speak with a senior partner if available, you may be able to gather a tiny historical sample. It may require a couple of hours, after which you may or may not be happy with the consensus—if indeed there was any.\r\n\r\nThe client awaits your counsel.
